# Bergen-on-a-Budget

This project is a website made by a total of 3 students, one of them being myself. The website is built in purely HTML and CSS anc contains a total of zero lines of javascript. THe idea behind the website was to build a website for exchange students arriving in Bergen to be able to find affordable options in many different categories of every day life, while still keeping quality in tact(e.g., Clothing, Restaurants, Furniture, etc). 

To be able to run this website, you will have to download the repository and run the index.html file, and the code should run like normal. 

The website consists of this hierarchy:

{
    "homepage": {
        "Caf√©s": {},
        "Restaurants": {
            "UNAVAILABLE": {}
        },
        "Bars": {},
        "Shops": {
            "Clothing": {},
            "Groceries": {},
            "Household": {}
        },
        "About": {},
        "Gyms": {}
    }
}

The website is currently only available while being connected to the University of Bergen (UiB) network called Eudoroam or UiB-Gjest. 
Currently the Restaurants page is unavailable to be accessed at this time.
